# Diabetic Prediction System

## Project Overview
The Diabetic Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict diabetes using clinical health data. Utilizing algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, this system aims to provide accurate predictions to aid healthcare professionals and patients in early diagnosis and management of diabetes.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis:** Leverages historical health data to predict diabetes likelihood.
- **User Interface:** Simple and accessible web interface for easy interaction with the prediction system.
- **Data Handling:** Efficient data processing with robust data validation and preprocessing to ensure accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Deployment:** [Add deployment technologies if any, e.g., Docker, AWS, Heroku]

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
- **bash:** 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-prediction-system.git
cd diabetic-prediction-system

## Setting Up the Backend
- **Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages:**
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Start the Flask server:**
python app.py

## Setting Up the Frontend
- **Navigate to the frontend directory from the root of the project:**
cd frontend
npm install

- **Run the React application:**
npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
